# day 1 of my cool programming journey

considering this is my first entry, I want to share with you what I did prior to this. For the past 2 years I've kinda been on and off about my coding journey.
basically I did a lot of research about coding, made that coding resource sheet and watched a few videos and did some coding without much success (mainly lack of motivation).

Last summer I stumbled across this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnqBxcdjVGgT3uVR10bzTEB) and pretty much got through it over the next few months
I then stopped for a while but randomly on a train trip I got my laptop out, ran IDLE and started making a rpg.
I then realised, that I didn't have much motivation because I didn't find it fun.
Making that rpg was very fun (I'll post it below) and reignited my passion.

Now, I'm continuing on the coding resource timeline and slowly making my way through it all, and this is the first step I take into becoming a great developer.
I wish whoever's reading this, and me, a great future.

oh yeah what I did today

so basically I learnt how to use github and flexed my coding powers among my peers


``` python
import random

print ("""welcome to the pro yubby rpg

i spent a lot of time on this.""")
print (" choose your class(warrior, mage, archer")

user_class = input("""enter your class, make sure there are no capitals
""")
print ("your class is " + user_class + "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")

spells_for_sale = ["fireball", "heal", "shield"]
spellventory = []
if user_class == "warrior":
    health = 30
    attack = 20
    mana = 10
    weapons = 0
elif user_class == "mage":
    health = 15
    attack = 15
    mana = 30
else:
    health = 15
    attack = 35
    mana = 10
stats = ["health", health, "attack", attack, "mana", mana]
print (stats)

print ("""get ready for the rpg...
you will encounter monsters every turn, so be ready
every 5 encounters there will be a shop, so save your gold
oh no! theres a monster thereeeeeeeeeeeeeee
but first, buy some stuff(or not).
we hav: """ + str(spells_for_sale))
spells_bought = input()
if spells_bought == "fireball":
    spellventory.append("fireball")
elif spells_bought == "heal":
    spellventory.append("heal")
else:
    spellventory.append("shield")
    


print ("""
GOBLIN:
health = 500
attack = 5

will you fight, use a spell, or run?
""")

monster = "goblin"
monster_health = 500
goblin_attack = 5
fight_choice = input()

def fight_calculation():
     if attack_dice > monster_health:
        print ("the " + monster + " is dead!!!!!!!!!")
        monster_dead = True
        attack_dice = 0

if fight_choice == "fight":
    print (f"rolling {attack} side dice...")
    attack_dice = random.randint(1, attack)
    print (f"you attack with {attack_dice} damage!")
    if attack_dice > monster_health:
        print ("the " + monster + " is dead!!!!!!!!!")
        monster_dead = True
        attack_dice = 0
    else:
        print (str(monster_health - attack_dice) + " health left, you can do it!!!")

elif fight_choice == "run":
    print ("you ran away...")
else:
    if len(spellventory) > 0:
        print ("choose a spell: " + str(spellventory))
        spell_used = input()
        if spell_used == "fireball":
            attack_dice = 10
            if attack_dice > monster_health:   
                print ("the " + monster + " is dead!!!!!!!!!")
                monster_dead = True
                attack_dice = 0
            else:
               print (str(monster_health - attack_dice) + " health left, you can do it!!!")
            
            
            
    else:
        print ("you tried to cast a spell, but you had none...")
        ```


```
