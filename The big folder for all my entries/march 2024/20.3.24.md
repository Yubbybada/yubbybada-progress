# day 16 dictionaries

I learnt about dictionaries in this article [here](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/)

dictionaries contain key value pairs. you can obtain the value by using the key. for example:

``` python
fruit_colour = {apples: red, bananas: yellow, red grapes: purple}
print (fruit_colour[apples])
# will show red i think

```
they key or value can be anything

.items, .keys and .values are built in functions which return the corresponding thing


i then completed the quiz although I didnt get many right. I'm probably going to do it again soon
