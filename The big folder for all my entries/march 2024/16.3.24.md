# Learning pygame

I've always wanted to make games so this is the beginning

learning a simple geometry dash type of game [here](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/)

today I basically just copied down the code and tried to understand where they're coming from
I learnt some new stuff tho like setting up the display

``` python
import pygame

# Import pygame.locals for easier access to key coordinates
# Updated to conform to flake8 and black standards
from pygame.locals import (
    K_UP,
    K_DOWN,
    K_LEFT,
    K_RIGHT,
    K_ESCAPE,
    KEYDOWN,
    QUIT,
)

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
# screen dimensions
```
