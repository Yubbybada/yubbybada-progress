# day 19 more structure reading

So I'm continuing with the reading of the how to structure python programs [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator)
I got to the blank lines bit

### source file encoding

I dont really know what they're talking about but I recognise ASCII characters 
and so I think we can't use other real life languages in python other than english

### imports

- imports should be on separate lines
- imports are always put at the top of a file

ranked from this:
1. Standard library imports.
2. Related third party imports.
3. Local application/library specific imports.

The rest of the stuff I don't know yet so I'll get to that when I need it

### Module Level Dunder Names

I dont know what these are yet but the doc says to put them before import statements except from __future__
