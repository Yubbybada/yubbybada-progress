# day 21 continuing with the organisation

so I'm continuing with the doc on how to structure/organise a python program [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves)

I got to the end of the whitespaces at the end of expressions and statements

### other reccomendations:

- always put a space before and after and operators and booleans (+, =, ==, =<, and, or)
- compound statements(multiple statements on the same line) are discouraged
``` python
# correct
if me == you:
  i_am_you()
do_me()
do_myself()
do_i()

# incorrect
if me == you: i_am_you
do_me(); do_myself(); do_i
```

anddddddddddddd thats all the time I have today. Thanks for reading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
