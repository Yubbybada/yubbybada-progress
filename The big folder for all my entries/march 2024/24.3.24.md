# day 20 continuing with the structure thing

So I'm continuing with the document about structure and organisation of a python program [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator)

I think I got up to module level dunders

### string quotes

In python single quotes and double quotes are the same but they can't be used together.
For more readability stick to one type(double quotes for me).

For triple quoted strings use double quotes

### whitespace(spaces that don't do anything) in expressions and statements

avoid whitespaces in the following situations:
- immediately inside {}, [] or ():

``` python
# correct
sandwich(bread[1], {ham: 2})
# incorrect
sandwich( bread[ 1 ], { ham: 2 } )
```
- between a trailing comma and a following close paranthesis:
``` python
# correct
age = (2,)
# incorrect
age = (2, )
```
  I would have gotten that incorrect

- before a comma, semicolon, or colon:
``` python
# correct
if age == 5:
  print (x, y); x, y = y, x
# yea idk what any of that is supposed to be used for
# incorrect
if age == 5 :
  print (x , y) ; x , y = y , x
```
- immediately before the open () that starts the argument list of a function call
``` python
# correct
hi(hello)
# incorrect
hi (hello)
```
- before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or slicing:
``` python
# correct
hi["yes"] = 1st[index]
# incorrect
hi ["yes"] = 1st [index]
```
- more than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to align it with another
``` python
# correct
hi = yes
pi = nyes
long_variableeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee = hi
# incorrect
hi                                    = yes
pi                                    = nyes
long_variableeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee = hi
```
Phew that took too long

goodbye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
