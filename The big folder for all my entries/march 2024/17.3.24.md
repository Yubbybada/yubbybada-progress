# more progress on learning pygame

I kept on following the python tutorial [here](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/)
and kinda got a bit confused around the classes bit so I read some w3 schools articles about classes and inheritance + watched a video from real python

So far I got a white square on the top left corner of the screen. Making progress

(at the bottom of the sprites chapter if anyone's following)

``` python

import pygame

# Import pygame.locals for easier access to key coordinates
# Updated to conform to flake8 and black standards
from pygame.locals import (
    K_UP,
    K_DOWN,
    K_LEFT,
    K_RIGHT,
    K_ESCAPE,
    KEYDOWN,
    QUIT,
)


SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
# screen dimensions

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
  # Defines a Player object by extending pygame.sprite.Sprite
  # surface on screen is now an attribute of player
  def __init__(self):
    # initiates thing
    super(Player, self).__init__()
    # super copies properties and methods of pygame sprite class
    self.surf = pygame.Surface((75, 25))
    self.surf.fill((255, 255, 255))
    self.rect = self.surf.get_rect()


# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
# makes the actual screen

running = True
# variable to keep the game loop running

# Instantiate player. Right now, this is just a rectangle.
player = Player()

while running:
  #dont need == true
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == KEYDOWN:
      # did u press key??????????
      if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
        # did you press escape?????
          running = False
          # STAAAUUUUUPPPPPPPPPP

      elif event.type == QUIT:
        running = False



  screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
  # gives the surface a colour

  
  screen.blit(player.surf, player.rect)
  # blit allows surf to be show on screen
  pygame.display.flip()
```
