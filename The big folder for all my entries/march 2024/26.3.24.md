# day 22 continuing with the python organisation doccccccccccccc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i got to the last bit of other reccomendations

### trailing commas

I dont know what these are but in case for the future use them when a version control system is used

### comments

- comments that contradict the code is worse than no comments!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! always update comments after changing the code
- first word should be capitalised (maybe I'll do that(ahahahhahhaahhahahahahahhahahahahahah i probably wont))
- block comments generally consist of 2 or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences with each paragraph ending in a full stop
- make sure your comments are clear and understandable by others

### block comments

block comments I think are just big blobs of writing that you need

each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space

paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a single # line

### inline comments

- use dem sparingly
- an inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement (for example `print ("hi")              # this is an inline commentttttttt`)
- they should be at least 2 spaces from the statement
- inline comments can be unnecessary and distracting if they state the obvious. for example:
``` py
# incorrect
x = x + 1               # increment the x
```
but sometimes this is useful
``` python
# correct
x = x + 1               # compensate for border
```
welp ty for reading remember to smash that like button, HIT that notification bell and SUSCRIBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
