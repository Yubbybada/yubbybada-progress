# Movement

today I managed to add basic movement to my sprite(rectangle) using the resource I'm following [here](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/)

I looked at a article on dictionaries in python which was quite interesting and I think I understand them a lot better tho I am going to do the quiz provided with the article

code here

``` python
import pygame
from pygame.display import update

# Import pygame.locals for easier access to key coordinates
# Updated to conform to flake8 and black standards
from pygame.locals import (
    K_UP,
    K_DOWN,
    K_LEFT,
    K_RIGHT,
    K_ESCAPE,
    KEYDOWN,
    QUIT,
)


SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
# screen dimensions

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
  # Defines a Player object by extending pygame.sprite.Sprite
  # surface on screen is now an attribute of player
  def __init__(self):
    # initiates thing
    super(Player, self).__init__()
    # super copies properties and methods of pygame sprite class
    self.surf = pygame.Surface((75, 25))
    self.surf.fill((255, 255, 255))
    self.rect = self.surf.get_rect()

  def update(self, pressed_keys):
    # all the user inputs and corresponding movement
    if pressed_keys[K_UP]:
      self.rect.move_ip(0, -5),
    if pressed_keys[K_DOWN]:
      self.rect.move_ip(0, 5),
    if pressed_keys[K_LEFT]:
      self.rect.move_ip(-5, 0),
    if pressed_keys[K_RIGHT]:
      self.rect.move_ip(5, 0),

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
# makes the actual screen

running = True
# variable to keep the game loop running

# Instantiate player. Right now, this is just a rectangle.
player = Player()

while running:
  #dont need == true
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == KEYDOWN:
      # did u press key??????????
      if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
        # did you press escape?????
          running = False
          # STAAAUUUUUPPPPPPPPPP

      elif event.type == QUIT:
        running = False

  pressed_keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
  # gets the set of keys pressed and checks for user input

  player.update(pressed_keys)
  # updates player sprite

  screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
  # gives the surface a colour

  
  screen.blit(player.surf, player.rect)
  # blit allows surf to be show on screen
  # currently at top left of screen
  pygame.display.flip()
```
