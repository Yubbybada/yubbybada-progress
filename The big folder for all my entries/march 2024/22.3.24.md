# day 18 writing more readable code

so I made a reddit post a few days ago [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1bkjco6/how_do_i_organisestructure_a_program/)
and I asked for some help on how to organise/structure code.
There were a lot of respondents kind enough to help me and gave me some resources.
One resource they gave me was [this](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces) and it's documentation on the structure of python code.

I read a bit of it and I now know I shouldn't indent using tabs. Spaces give more flexibility and are preferred by most python programmers

Top level functions(I searched some stuff up and I think they're everything thats not indented) and classes should use 2 blank spaces, 
method definitions in a class should be surrounded by blank spaces, 
and thats all the time I got today.
