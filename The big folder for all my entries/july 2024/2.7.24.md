# day 4

ive been gone for a ,ong time ig

motivation...

anyway im watching one piece and im going to read the atomic habits book

so ive been learning python in school and as usual absolutely clapping everyone but doing python has given me more motivation

im going to start a project that allows me to track my episodes and when i finish + other stuff

``` py
import time
from datetime import date, datetime, time

# imports required modules

print ("you started on the 1st July, 2024")
time.sleep(1)
before = date(year = 2024, month = 7, day = 1) + time(hour = 16, minute = 3, second = 24)
today = datetime.now()
print (f"you will finish on the {before - today}")

episodes_watched = int(input("how many episodes have you watched\n"))
int(episodes_watched)
total_episodes = 1110
total_op_watchtime = total_episodes * 22.5
total_ew_watchtime = episodes_watched * 22.5
total_watchtime_left = total_op_watchtime - total_ew_watchtime
# episodes stuff

print (f"you have watched {episodes_watched} out of {total_episodes} episodes")
time.sleep(1)
print (f"EPISODES LEFT: you have {total_episodes - episodes_watched} left")
time.sleep(1)
print (f"""MINUTES: you have around {total_watchtime_left} minutes left,
HOURS: {total_watchtime_left / 60} hours left,
DAYS: {total_watchtime_left / 60 / 24} days left""")
```
i dont wanna write more so i lose motivation so look and see
