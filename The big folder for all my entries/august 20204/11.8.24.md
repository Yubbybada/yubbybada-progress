# day 47

so uh.. its been some time  

well a lot of stuff has happened  
and i promise you i disappeared for a good reason  
well mostly good  

so first of all i had my end of year tests which i had to revise for

then after that i had a lot of time but yk life came and i almost got really rizzy  
then after that we went to prague and vienna for holiday  
and ive been teaching my friend ben python along the way so im not fully rusted up  

but the big new thing is that im now learning roblox studio  
cause when i was teaching ben python he wanted to make roblox games and i said why not and now im into this mess

a good thing is that i actually enjoy roblox studio a lot more than python so im focusing on that for now  
which also means ill be posting roblox studio progress on here instead

itll be more short cause i dont wanna write an entire essay for everything i did.

also forgot to mention that im in my summer holidays so i have a lot more time left to code

anyway today im doing this doc by roblox where i learn lua [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/tutorials/fundamentals/coding-3/multiple-conditions)

goodbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
