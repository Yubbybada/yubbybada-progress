# day 29

GUYS/GALS I DID DO WORK BUT THEN I FORGOT TO SAVE IT AND NOW ALL MY PROGRESS IS GONE :sob:

im just gonna skim through the video im doing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)

**always write class names in CamelCase**

- classes help organise code
- they help reuse code
- theyre used everywhere
- some modules require you to make classes
- they make it easier to make it work with scope(idk what this is but the video says it'll explain it later)

example of class:
``` python
class Monster:
  health = 90
  energy = 40
