# day 33 more OOP video

if ya dont know im following this python OOP and classes vid [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)

im gonna be following the same format as yesterday so i code in a different editor but post notes here

i got to 28:30 in time

code from yesterday im continuing:
``` python
class Monster:
    # methods
    health = 90
    energy = 40
    
    # methods
    def attack(self, amount):
        print ("the monster has attacked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
        print (f"{amount} damage was dealt")
    
    def move(self, speed):
        print (f"the monster has moved at {speed} speed")
    
monster = Monster()
print (monster.health)
monster.attack(40)
monster.move(20)
```

### __dunder__ methods  
dunder stands for double underscore  
but we're still talking about methods

a dunder method is a method that is not called by the user  
but instead called by python when something happens

examples:  
`__init__` is called when the object is created  
`__len__` is called when the object is passed into len()  
`__abs__` is called when the object is passed into abs()

to create a monster object with different attributes we need a dunder method  
it is created with the `__init__` method which is called when the object is created  
for example:  
``` python
def __init__(self):
  print ("monster was created")
```
whenever the `Monster()` method is called it prints "monster was created"

ok sorry i havent done much as i was watching anime with ben but i hope i can do it tmr

my code so far
``` python
class Monster:
    # attributes
    health = 90
    energy = 40
    
    # dunder method
    def __init__(self):
        print ("the monster was created")
    
    # methods
    def attack(self, amount):
        print ("the monster has attacked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
        print (f"{amount} damage was dealt")
    
    def move(self, speed):
        print (f"the monster has moved at {speed} speed")
    
monster = Monster()
print (monster.health)
monster.attack(40)
monster.move(20)
```
