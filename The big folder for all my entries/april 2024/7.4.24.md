# day 26 finishing the document

so if youre new here ive been documenting this document [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves)
and today i have a lot of time so i might finish it

I just finished public and internal interfaces so now I'm onto programming reccomendations

## programming reccomendations

- code should be written in a way so that it doesnt disadvantage other python implementations
- comparisons to singletons(eg. None) should be done with `is` or `is not `, never any equality operators
- use `is not` rather than `not ... is`
- always use a `def ` statement instead of a assignment statement that binds a lambda directly to its identifier
  ``` py
  # correct
  def f(x): return 2*x

  # incorrect
  f = lambda x: 2*x
