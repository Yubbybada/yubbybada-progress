# day 26 finishing the document

so if youre new here ive been documenting this document [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves)
and today i have a lot of time so i might finish it

I just finished public and internal interfaces so now I'm onto programming reccomendations

## programming reccomendations

- code should be written in a way so that it doesnt disadvantage other python implementations
- comparisons to singletons(eg. None) should be done with `is` or `is not `, never any equality operators
- use `is not` rather than `not ... is`
- always use a `def ` statement instead of a assignment statement that binds a lambda directly to its identifier
  ``` py
  # correct
  def f(x): return 2*x

  # incorrect
  f = lambda x: 2*x
- use `Exception` rather than `BaseException`
- when catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions where possible instead of using a bare `except` clause
- for `try` clauses, limit the code necessary to as little as possible
- be consistent with return statements - either all return statements should return a function or none of them should
- use `.startswith()` and `.endswith()` to avoid errors
  ``` py
  # correct
  if me.startswith("hi"):
    print ("hi")

  # incorrect
  if me[:3] == ("hi"):
    print ("hello")
- for sequences - strings, lists, tuples, use the fact that empty sequences are false
  ``` py
  # correct
  if not seq:
  if seq:

  # incorrect
  if len(seq):
  if not len(seq)
- DONT COMPARE BOOLEAN VALUES TO TRUE OR FALSE USING `==` OR `is`
  ``` py
  # correct
  if agree:
    print ("yes")

  # incorrect:
  if agree == True:
    print ("yes")

  # worse
  if agree is True:
    print ("yes")
  ```
  those are all the important ones

  i finished it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
