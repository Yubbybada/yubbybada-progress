# day 33 real one

so sorry about the day before yesterday since i think i forgot how many days i was on

also this is gonna be a quick one

if ya dont know what I'm doing Im following an OOP and classes video on python [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)

i got to 31:45

if you dont know whats happenning look at the last entry

yesterday's code btw
``` python
class Monster:
    # attributes
    health = 90
    energy = 40
    
    # dunder method
    def __init__(self):
        print ("the monster was created")
    
    # methods
    def attack(self, amount):
        print ("the monster has attacked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
        print (f"{amount} damage was dealt")
    
    def move(self, speed):
        print (f"the monster has moved at {speed} speed")
    
monster = Monster()
print (monster.health)
monster.attack(40)
monster.move(20)
```

### __dunder__ methods continued

remember after the dunder method `__init__` we need to put a "self" parameter.  
we can also put other parameters into `__init__` such as health and energy

now if we put  
`self.health`  and
`self.energy`  
we can now put custom values for health and energy.

for example:  
``` python
monster1 = Monster(10, 20)  
monster2 = Monster(health = 50, energy = 100)

print (monster1.health)
print (monster2.health)
```
it will print `10` and `50`  
and since the `self` is a reference to the class itself we dont need the attributes `health` and `energy`

well thats enough for me i need to poop

``` python
class Monster:

    # dunder method
    def __init__(self, health, energy):
        self.health = health
        self.energy = energy
        print ("the monster was created")
    
    # methods
    def attack(self, amount):
        print ("the monster has attacked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
        print (f"{amount} damage was dealt")
    
    def move(self, speed):
        print (f"the monster has moved at {speed} speed")
    
monster1 = Monster(10,20)
monster2 = Monster(30, 70)
print (monster1.health)
print (monster2.health)
monster1.attack(40)
monster2.move(20)
```
finished at 34:35, i know that might not seem a lot but that took 15 mins

also if u think im smart using all this complicated language i am smart but im copying the complicated language from the video

goodbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
