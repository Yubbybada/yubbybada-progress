# day 25 more organisation

hi guys welcome to another one of my **banger** videos make sure to SMASH that like button, HIT that notification bell and remember to SUSCRIBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

in all seriousness, im gonna make a youtube video on making a game in python. My youtube channel is called yubbybada if you dont know.

oh well back to completing the structuring and organising a python program document [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves)

i think i got to function and method arguments

also keep in mind that im simplifying a lot of these stuff as there are some stuff i havent learnt yet but i do try to google stuff(thats the bits you see in brackets)

### method names and instance variables

name functions using lowercase and underscores to improve readability

use one leading underscore for non-public methods and instance variables(variables that aer only used in a class)

### constants

constants are usually defined on a module level and have all CAPS with underscores

### designing for inheritance

**note: i currently have a very very very very very very very very very veyr very vvyrev yer vyerv yrev yrev yerv yerv ye vyerv yevyrv yerv basic understanding of classes and inheritance 
that im planning to fix after I finish this document by watching a 2 hour long video on yt about python, object oriented programming, classes and inheritance so im basically copy pasting a 
bunch of stuff that hopefully I'll remember

- public attributes should have no leading underscores
- if your public attribute collides with a keyword add a trailing underscore
- for simple public data attributes its best to just expose the attribute name without complicated accessor/mutator methods(help whats mutators or accessors)
- if your class is intended to be subclassed and you have attributes that you don't want the subclasses to use, consider naming them with double leading underscores(idk why tho)

### public and internal interfaces

yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa idk what the public or internal is fully yet soooooooooooooooooooooooooo

# TY FOR WATCHING MY YOUTUBE VIDEO I HOPE U ENJOYED IT BYEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
