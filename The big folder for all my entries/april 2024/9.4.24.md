# day 27 moving onto a new video

so I finished the python structure and organisation doc and i feel like it helped my gain a better understanding for why i leave spaces and lines and all that

I'm moving onto a video where it explains classes and object oriented programming in python because when I was making that pygame thing I didn't understand that.

video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)

## what are objects??????????????????????????????????

an object is a container for variables and function

for example, a monster object in a video game could contain:
- variables for health, energy, stamina, damage, ...
- functions for attack, movements, animations, ...

**the variables and functions only exist inside the monster object**

variables and functions are called different things inside an object but work exactly the same  
variables in an object are called attributes  
functions in an object are called methods

methods are very common. for example:

``` python
yes = "sup guys welcome to my youtube channel"
print (yes.upper())
```
that would return `SUP GUYS WELCOME TO MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL`

the `.upper` is the method

a string in python is just another object with methods inside it.  
I'm still trying to get my head round that

integers, floats, booleans, and other stuff like that
are just objects

**it is possible to have multiple objects**

for example:
Monster 1:  
health = 90  
energy = 20  
attack  
move  

OK UNRELATED BUT I JUST FOUND OUT YOU CAN ADD NEW LINES BY ADDING 2 SPACES AT THEN END OF A LINE INSTEAD OF ANOTHER ENTER TY MEDIUM

Monster 2:  
health = 60  
energy = 40  
attack  
move

Monster 3:  
health = 40  
energy = 10  
attack  
move  

when you create a monster you can give it custom attributes but  
**you cant use customised methods for different objects**

for example:  
all 3 monsters have different health and energy values but the attack and move method is the same

methods can be customised to an extent but not as nearly as enough as attributes

**each object has its own attributes and methods**

**objects can also interact with each other**  
for example if monster 3 attacks monster 2 we can run code to make monster 2 lose health

## what is object oriented programming(OOP)???

**all this means is that your code is organised with different objects, then you make these objects interact with each other**

this is how almost all large projects are made

you can have an object without and methods

**you can add a function or an object inside of another object's attribute**

for example:  
Player:  
health = 40  
energy = 10  
weapon = axe  
attack  
menu  
move

menu:  
player = Player  
select  
close  

the object Player is being passed to Menu which means that the Menu object can interact with Player

**OBJECTS CAN INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER**

using objects is how you want to organise code - it makes it easy to work with
