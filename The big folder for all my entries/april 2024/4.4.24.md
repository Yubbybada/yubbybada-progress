# day 24 more procrastination (again)

procrastinated a lot today again but at least im getting it done

if youre new here im following [this](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves) on how to structure and organise a python program



I got  to the descriptive naming styles

### naming styles part 2

these special naming styles for stuff like variables and classes can also be used:

- `_single_leading_underscore` (weak internal use indicator(help i still dont know what an internal use indicator is even after searching it up))
- `single_trailing_underscore_` (used to avoid conflicts with python keywords)
- `__double_leading_underscore` (when naming a class attribute it invokes name mangling(i cant understand this either cause stack overflow overlords use too many complex words))
- `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscores__` ("magic" objects or attributes that live in user controlled namespaces(i copied that word for word) eg. `__init__`. NEVER make such names.

## naming conventions(guidlines)

names to avoid:
- single letter l(lowercase L)
- single letter O(capital o)
- single letter I(capital i)

use characters that are compatible with ASCII(the funny binary alphabet kinda thing)

packages and modules should be short and all lowercase

### class names

class names should use the capitalised words convention(eg. HiThere)

gonna miss some not important stuff out

### function and variable names

function names should all be lowercase with underscores to improve readability

variable names should be the same

### function and method arguments

always use `self` for the first argument to instance methods

always use `cls` for the first argument to instance methods

### the end of today

welp thats all I have time for today cause i procrastinated a lot

its only 11 30 and its the holidays so you might be wondering, why am i sleeping so early?

well i found out that youre not reading this and that this is not early, but im going running tommorow morning

goodnight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
