# day 23 procrastination and more organisation

so I missed a couple days for a few reasons:
- it was the the start easter holidays on the 28th march 2024
- i wanted a rest
- i went on holiday from sunday to monday
- april fools was on monday
- procrastination
  
hopefully the rest of the easter holidays will be filled with lots of coding

also im counting the days coding not by how many days i did since i started but the days on which i made a diary entry

if you're new here im learning about python program structure and organisation [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves)

i think i got to block comments but idk sooooooooooooooooooooo

### inline comments

an inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement like this

` print ("hiiiiiii")     # hi this is an inline comment`

they should be at least 2 spaces away from the original statement

use dem sparingly

they can be distracting and unnecessary if they state the obvious
but sometimes they are useful
``` python
# incorrect
x = x + 1      # increment x

# correct
x = x + 1      # compensate for border(i have no idea what that means)
```
I just realised i did inline comments last entry...

### doc strings (documentation strings)

I didnt know what they were so i looked it up on this website [here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/docstrings)

they are basically comments but you can only put them after the defition of a function, method, class or module.

you can use them like this:
``` python
def say_hi:
  """ print hi"""
  print ("hi")
```
you dont need triple quotes but its good for practice

they basically explain what the code does - thats different from comments

anyway back to the structure

welp it said to go to pep 257 so im going there(its [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)

ok so im looking through and it says that you have to use them as a command:

for example, instead of "prints hi" it should be "print hi" as if youre talking to someone

read through all of it and i have a vague idea of what they're talking about so lets move on...

### naming conventions( i learnt that conventions are kind of guidelines)

theres a lot of different naming styles(to name stuff like variables, classes, functions, e.t.c.)

the most common ones are:
- `b` (single lowercase letter)
- `B ` (single capital letter)
- `lowercase`
- `lower_case_with_underscores`
- `CAPITALLETTERS`
- `CAPITAL_LETTERS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
- `CapitalisedWords`
- `mixedCase`
- `Capital_Words_With_Underscores`

welp i think thats all im doing today, it was ok when i was learning but getting started was really difficult.

i hope I continue my coding journey.
