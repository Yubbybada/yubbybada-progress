# day 31 more cool video

officially a month of coding!!!!!!!!!

oh yea the reason ive been gone for so long is a big lack of motivation

it hits hard.

anyway if youre new here ive been noting down a video of OOP and classes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)

at time 16:16

### classes code thing

theres a coding bit so im just gonna write that in my own editor but write notes here

- Write classes in CamelCase
- call class using name then calling it using brackets(for example `Monster()`)
- capture using variable
- print specific attribute by using `.[attribute]` for example `print (monster.health)`
- attributes only exist in the class
- create methods the same as a function
- python automatically passes an argument into the method so we have to use at least 1 parameter to capture it(usually "self")

I was gonna do the dunder methods bit but i looked at the time(10:25pm) and im a bit tired

putting the code I worked on below
``` python
class Monster:
    # methods
    health = 90
    energy = 40
    
    # methods
    def attack(self, amount):
        print ("the monster has attacked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
        print (f"{amount} damage was dealt")
    
    def move(self, speed):
        print (f"the monster has moved at {speed} speed")
    
monster = Monster()
print (monster.health)
monster.attack(40)
monster.move(20)
```
