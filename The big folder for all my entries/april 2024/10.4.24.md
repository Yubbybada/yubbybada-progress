# day 28 continuing with classes and oop python video

so I'm continuing the python video on what classes and oop is.

I got to 8:50 in the video

## what are classes?

**A class is a blueprint for an object**

**whenever we create a object we first need a class**

A class also accepts arguments to customise the object

for example, this would be a class:  
Monster  
health = ?  
energy = ?  
attack  
move  

the 2 attributes health and energy are unknown and can change  
the 2 methods attack and move cannot be changed

When we use a class we give it specific values to create an object

for example, we give some values to the Monster class.

Monster  
health = 90  
energy = 20  
attack  
move  

the values of the attributes health and energy have changed however the methods attack and move have not

we can do this process an unlimited amount of times

**we always need a class to create an object**

**a class can inherit from another class.**  
**the resulting objects will have attributes and methods from both classes**

for example, we wanna make a shark class:

Shark  
speed = ?  
bite

this class is limited cause it doesnt have health, energy, movement.  
the shark class can inherit the attributes and methods from the monster class

When we use the shark class to create the shark object it will inherit from the monster class creating this:

Shark  
health = 90  
energy = 20  
speed = 100  
attack  
move  
bite

you can see the shark inherited methods and attributes from the Monster class

gtg now ty for reading!!!!!!!
