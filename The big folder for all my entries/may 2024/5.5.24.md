# day 35

i missed some bits where i could have been coding but at least i started today

if youre new here I'm watching a python video about what OOP is and how classes work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)

i got to 41:56 on the vid

### dunder methods continued continued continued continued

#### cool project

for the vid i need to research the `__str__` method and how to use it

str is a built in function that makes it so when you print the class object it returns a string

``` py
class Monster:
    
    # dunder method
    def __init__(self, health, energy):
        self.health = health
        self.energy = energy
        print ("the monster was created")
        
    def __len__(self):
        return "yes"
        
    def __call__(self):
        return "the monster was called :)"
        
    def __str__(self):
        return "hi"
    
    # methods
    def attack(self, amount):
        print ("the monster has attacked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
        print (f"{amount} damage was dealt")
    
    def move(self, speed):
        print (f"the monster has moved at {speed} speed")
    
monster1 = Monster(10,20)
monster2 = Monster(30, 70)
print (monster1())
print (monster1)
```
my code for the dunder methods section

### classes in python deep dive

** everything in python is an object**

damn i just procrastinated for another 7 hours.  
its 12 am now

a function and a method are basically the same thing,  
the only difference is that methods belong to an object

ok so im pretty tired so i just watched the video and only took the key notes.

theres an excercise coming up that I'm saving for tommorow.

i just tried something to combat procrastination by doing nothing and it seemed to have worked

i got to 53:00 on the vid

goodnight
