# day 35 more python OOP and classes vid

ig motivation is a really big part of it huh

making projects was so much easier

if youre new here i've been following a video tutorial on what python classes are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)

got to 37:08

### dunder methods continued continued continued

so theres a function called `dir` short for directory listing,  
and it lists all the dunder methods, attributes and methods.

for example if you printed the dir of monster(`print (dir(monster1))` it would print
`['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getstate__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'attack', 'energy', 'health', 'move']`  
wow that stretches long.  
anyway you can see the attributes energy and health and the methods attack and move

another dunder method is `__call__`  
what it does is that it turns the object into a function(i think)  
what we can do now is print (monster1())

another another dunder method is `__add__`  
you can probably guess what it does

oh well a challenge just came up but i dont think i have time(its 12 30 am(you can tell ive been procrastinating))  
i did like 20 mins so thats pretty embarrassing

oh well i got to 42:15 on the video

``` py
class Monster:
    
    # dunder method
    def __init__(self, health, energy):
        self.health = health
        self.energy = energy
        print ("the monster was created")
        
    def __len__(self):
        return "yes"
        
    def __call__(self):
        return "the monster was called :)"
    
    # methods
    def attack(self, amount):
        print ("the monster has attacked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
        print (f"{amount} damage was dealt")
    
    def move(self, speed):
        print (f"the monster has moved at {speed} speed")
    
monster1 = Monster(10,20)
monster2 = Monster(30, 70)
print (monster1())
```
code so far

goodnightttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
