# day 37

mb for yesterday it was supposed to say day 36

anyway im following a video tutorial on classes are in python [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)

### classes in python deep dive continued

im doing the project at 53:07

#### mini project

1. i need to create a Monster class with a parameter called func, and it should be stored as a parameter
2. i need to to create another class called Attacks which has 4 methods called bite, strike, slash and kick that all print some text
3. i need to create a Monster object and give it an attack method from the attack class

so creating the monster class is super easy (just `class Monster:`) but adding the parameter is a bit harder.  
i tried searching it up but i cant find anything so im just gonna assume the parameter is an attribute  
ok that didnt work but chatgpt will come to the rescue.  

ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

i need to use the dunder method `__init__`  
``` python
class Monster:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
```
so far it looks like that.

i really should have started sooner my time has ran out

goodbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
