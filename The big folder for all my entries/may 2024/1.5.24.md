# day 34 more OOP and classes vid

I know it might have been a long time, but motivation is at a low.

anyway if youre new i've been following this vid [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vr5faCXFo8)  
and if you want you can look at the previous entries for some context

### dunder methods continued continued

another dunder method is `__len__`  
you still have to put `self` as a parameter tho

now if I make a method(remember not a function cause its in a class) called `__len__` as so and return anything(really anything idk why tho),  
``` python
def __len__(self):
  return "yes"
```

and pass in a string or list(doesnt work with numbers tho) when calling the method then print

``` py
print (len("hillo"))
```
so thats cool ig

now we're going to do the same thing but with the dunder method `__abs__`

``` python
def __abs__(self):
  return self.energy

print (abs(monster1))
```
now if you're wondering what abs means(like meeeeeeeeeeeee) it is the absolute value of a number.  
if you still don't know what that means (like meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) it's basically the positive value of a negative number(thats from google btw)  
so `print (abs(-20))` would return `20`

and thats enough for me today

i hope i can continue more cause i wanna learn to code but procrastination and roblox islands is too powerful.

i got to 37:08 on the vid

heres my code so far
``` py
class Monster:
    
    # dunder method
    def __init__(self, health, energy):
        self.health = health
        self.energy = energy
        print ("the monster was created")
        
    def __len__(self):
        return "yes"
    
    # methods
    def attack(self, amount):
        print ("the monster has attacked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
        print (f"{amount} damage was dealt")
    
    def move(self, speed):
        print (f"the monster has moved at {speed} speed")
    
monster1 = Monster(10,20)
monster2 = Monster(30, 70)
print (len([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))
```
goodnight
