# day 38 working on project

only have 6 mins so gotta work fast

im continuing the project from last entry so look there if you want context

### cool project

 1. i need to create a Monster class with a parameter called func, and it should be stored as a parameter  
 2. i need to to create another class called Attacks which has 4 methods called bite, strike, slash and kick that all print some text  
 3. i need to create a Monster object and give it an attack method from the attack class

i already did number 1
``` py
class Monster:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
```
thats what it looks like so far

making a class is just `class Attacks:`  
the methods should be easy - i just need to do `def` then name of method then `print ("Used [methodthing]!")`

so altogether it is
``` py
class Monster:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
        
class Attacks:
    
    def bite:
        print ("Used bite!")
        
    def slash:
        print ("Used slash!")
        
    def strike:
        print ("Used strike!")
        
    def kick:
        print ("Used kick!")
```
andddddddd thats it for today

sorry i waspretty busy installing blinds

anyway goodbye and goodnight
