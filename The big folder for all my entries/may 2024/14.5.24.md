# day 39 quitting the vid and moving onto projects

so videos on python have been very unsuccessful and my attention span has gotten worrying. tiktok does not help

im trying to get more coding videos on my homepage so i can watch longer form content more

to do that i need to get my old reccomendations on youtube back

what im going to do is focus on project based learning and for my next project im writing a script that watches all my videos from my watch history so i get my old reccomendations back

i have no idea how to do this but my motivation is very low

have to sleep now goodbye
