# some brainstorming

So I was playing some undertale and finally completed the genocide undyne boss fight(for those who dont know what that is it's a really cool bossfight with great music) and I've decided to post my music progress too.

Didn't do any code today but I've watched(going to watch) some cakewalk tutorials
