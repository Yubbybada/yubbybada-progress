# yubbybada's progress
my programming journey!!!!!!!!

Yes I wrote that and I'm not changing it

Anyway this repository serves as a record of how I became a programmer(not yet) and has some resume uses

Also its fun to look back at how far you came

# Contents
### Schedule
I aim to code at least twice a week, as I am involved in other stuff too. 

If I ever start to slow down on my schedule, send me an angry email
### How to navigate
so far, I haven't wrote a single entry yet but I imagine they'll look a bit like this:

- All entries will be in one giant folder separated by months

- Projects will be in separate folders and entries will be written there as well as a mini entry in the big folder.

- A folder to all the resources I used will also be available

Maybe this system will change as I literally just read a few tutorials on how to use github

### Special thanks

Thanks OumarYanni's One-Commit-Per-Day for inspiration for a lot of the layout

Also thanks to shepherd-06 and MjMoshi for their programming diaries to serve as inspiration

## Some extra context about me

I am a young teen looking to one day making a fully functioning game.

To do this I have some priorities (it goes in order of importance):

- Learn how to code (python at this moment)

- Learn how to make music

- Learn how to make art

Posting progress of those here too but it will mainly be programming

### Juicy parts

If you're here viewing this and don't have much time I reccomend reading day 1, skipping everything else and moving onto the march folder
