# day 42

motivation is low

anyway now cause the other thing didnt work I'm following a video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIZRskDMyA4)

so first i have to get an api key  
next i need to download this google api client [here](https://pypi.org/project/google-api-python-client/)  
woah i can tell this is already better than the other simple tutorial cause its showing me where to get the stuff  
theres a bunch of stuff there that i can spend hours looking at but i'll just follow the vid

omg this guy is so good  
hes going through everything step by step

I DID IT

well sort of

its not exactly the same as his but i think they updated the api

heres my code btw
``` py
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

api_key = "AIzaSyCN6KT8PGEgYnd9T9c08beRpVM479zL56g"

youtube = build("youtube", "v3", developerKey = api_key)

# making a request to the yt api
request = youtube.channels().list(part = "statistics", forUsername = "DailyDoseOfInternet")

# get a response from the api
response = request.execute()
```

well my motivation is sort of there

it isnt as big as the rpg cause i don't know a lot of this stuff

its about finding the right balance of hard but not too hard and easy but not too easy

anyway tmr I hope to fix it cause i sort of have an idea of what to do so goodnight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
