# youtube homepage recommendations fixer/transferer

so i need to get my old homepage back cause right now its been filled with short form content that is slowly going to lower my attention span to 0

to do this im going to write a script that watches all my old videos

yup im hoping project based learning will fix my motivation problem

anywayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

### how to do

in all honesty, idk  
i found a script someone had wrote but i wont copy it comepletely
im just going to refer to it if I'm stuck

ok found this [thing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-extract-youtube-data-in-python/) that i can follow to hopefully get my watch history  
i went to the yt api and made a project  
if it isnt obvious already i am completely new to these terms and googling a lot of stuff

ok i got the youtube analytics api which was surprisingly easy  
now i got my credentials i just need to follow the tutorial

yk what its 11pm i wanna sleep earlier so goodnight

I'll see yall tmr

code so far
```py
from youtube_statistics import YTstats

API_key = 746377501834-0ocupbtt9euqd1q6oj67qq36rb5vh8ek

channel_id = UCuXl9fpqjTHX9OXKyaatEjw

yt = YTstats(API_KEY, channel_id)
yt.get_channel_statistics()
yt.dump()
