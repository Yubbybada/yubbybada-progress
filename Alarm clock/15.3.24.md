# The end

welp i tried to add a bunch of stuff to the pomodoro clock but it would take too much time and I wanna make something in pygame. This is the end of the alarm clock project

This was fairly successful as I have something I can use and its functioning. maybe one day in the future I'll make an upgraded version

code below

``` python
import time
from playsound import playsound
import winsound

user_loops = int(input("How many loops of the pomodoro timer do you want?(including breaks): "))
sound_loop = int(input("How many loops of the alarm do you want?: "))

user_hour = int(input("How many hours you would the study time to last for?: "))
user_minute = int(input("How many minutes you would like the study time to last for?: "))
user_second = int(input("How many seconds you would like the study time to last for?: "))
# asks for study time

user_break_hour = int(input("How many hours you would the break time to last for?: "))
user_break_minute = int(input("How many minutes you would like the break time to last for?: "))
user_break_second = int(input("How many seconds you would like the break time to last for?: "))
# asks for break time


if user_minute >= 60 or user_second >= 60 or user_break_minute >= 60:
  print ("\nplease change your minutes or seconds to 59 or below\n")
  exit()
# checks if the minutes or seconds is above the limit


for pomo in range(user_loops):
  def hour():
    final_hour = user_hour * 3600
    return final_hour
  # calculates hours
  
  def minute():
    final_minute = user_minute * 60
    return final_minute
  # calculates minutes
  
  final_second = user_second
  # just to make it even
  
  
  final_hour = hour()
  final_minute = minute()
  final_time = final_hour + final_minute + final_second
  # calculates final time
  
  
  
  print (f"That is {final_time} seconds of study")
  time.sleep(0.5)
  #some extra stuff to know

  for seconds in reversed(range(final_time + 1)):
    # checks if time is 0
    print (f"{final_hour // 3600:02}:{final_minute// 60:02}:{final_second:02}")
    # prints the time remaining
  
    final_second -= 1
    # takes away the seconds
  
    if final_second == -1:
      final_minute -= 60
      final_second = 59
      # checks if seconds == 0 then changes minutes
      if final_minute == -1:
        final_hour -= 1
        final_minute = 59 * 60
        # checks if minutes == 0 then changes hours
  
      # checks if final final time is 0 then breaks
    if final_time > 0:
      time.sleep(1)
    # waits a second
  

  for x in range(sound_loop):
    playsound("chrome music lab ring.wav")

  play_sound = input("enter \"continue\" to continue\n")
