# sound playing while code running

I want the alarm bell to ring but theres an option to stop it as it's ringing

I looked it up https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52769618/how-can-i-play-a-sound-while-other-lines-of-code-execute-simultaneously and I think I need to use the thread package

I didn't do much today tho I can do a lot tommorow cause it's an inset day
