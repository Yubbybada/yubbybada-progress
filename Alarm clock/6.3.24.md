# Day 2 of my cool coding progress journey

Didn't do a lot today cause I had other stuff going on but I'm starting a mini alarm clock project.

Looked up how to add time to my code and added some seconds

Tried to find out how to add sound but I don't think you can on replit

welp this is all I have time for

code below(Just started this today ik it needs a lot of optimisation)

``` python
import time
from playsound import playsound

minute = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 
         21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 
         39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 
         57, 58, 59, 60]
# for second in str(minute):
#   print ("tick")
#   time.sleep(1)








# import required module

# for playing note.wav file
playsound('/path/note.wav')
`````
