# pretty productive day.

well I did make a very big start on this but then I learned that turning on opera gx performance mode deletes your github unsaved progress

i am very bummed

## outline of project

I'm making a pomodoro timer (changed from an alarm clock) cause it'll improve my coding skills and I think it'll be quite fun

I want it to have:

- a functioning countdown timer
- options for the timer
- a break
- options for the break
- a cool ringtone
- it works on both the replit and python IDLE
- it has a cool interface
## sound

so first I had to figure out to add alarm sounds

after some tutorials I figured out the package `playsound` but that won't work on replit so I had to use the replit package instead

I picked up some royalty free ring and ping sounds, slotted them into the directory(i learnt that today) then I was good to go

```` python
from playsound import playsound
audio.play_file("ping.mp3")
````
thats the code for the IDLE

## the actual countdown timer

so this was the lengthiest part of today

I learnt about the `time` module a few days ago and tried to come up with a countdown but it was pretty difficult.

I once again turned to my new friend. google. lots of searching up later and a few tutorials plus around an hour and a half I managed to come up with this(keep in mind that I am a complete beginner):

```` python

for seconds in reversed(range(final_time + 1)):
  # checks if time is 0
  final_second -= 1
  # takes away the seconds
  
  if final_second < 0:
    final_minute -= 1
    final_second = 59
    # checks if seconds == 0 then changes minutes
    if final_minute < 0:
      final_hour -= 1
      final_minute = 59 * 60
      # checks if minutes == 0 then changes hours
  
  print (f"{final_hour // 3600:02}:{final_minute// 60:02}:{final_second:02}")
  # prints the time remaining
  
  final_final_time = final_hour + final_minute + final_second
  if final_final_time <= 0:
    break
    # checks if final final time is 0 then breaks
  
  time.sleep(1)
  # waits a second
````
I tried not to directly copy it and managed to make it my own and I'm pretty happy with the result

I learnt around 10 new things today

and also added an option of the time

## new ringtone

so I decided that the ping/ring was a bit boring and didn't really work well so I decided to make my own ringtone

since I know nothing about music production(yet although I do play the cello) I had to go to chrome music lab for some help

![me making a ringtone on chrome music lab](https://github.com/Yubbybada/yubbybada-progress/assets/159492176/6e928805-078b-49dc-80b3-54a0e7ae6c1e)

I took some inspiration from the end of the menu theme from undertale and the samsung alarm my mum has

## the project so far

ok so far I've managed to implement a customisable countdown and a cool ringtone. 

```` python
import time
from replit import audio


user_hour = int(input("Enter how many hours you would like it to last for: "))
user_minute = int(input("Enter how many minutes you would like it to last for: "))
user_second = int(input("Enter how many seconds you would like it to last for: "))
# asks for user input of time

if user_minute >= 60 or user_second >= 60:
  print ("\nplease change your minutes or seconds to 59 or below\n")
  exit()

  

def hour():
  final_hour = user_hour * 3600
  return final_hour
# calculates hours

def minute():
  final_minute = user_minute * 60
  return final_minute
# calculates minutes

final_second = user_second
# just to make it even


final_hour = hour()
final_minute = minute()
final_time = final_hour + final_minute + final_second
# calculates final time



print (f"That is {final_time} seconds")
time.sleep(0.1)
print (f"{user_hour:02}:{user_minute:02}:{user_second:02}")
time.sleep(1)
#some extra stuff to know

for seconds in reversed(range(final_time + 1)):
  # checks if time is 0
  final_second -= 1
  # takes away the seconds
  
  if final_second < 0:
    final_minute -= 1
    final_second = 59
    # checks if seconds == 0 then changes minutes
    if final_minute < 0:
      final_hour -= 1
      final_minute = 59 * 60
      # checks if minutes == 0 then changes hours
  
  print (f"{final_hour // 3600:02}:{final_minute// 60:02}:{final_second:02}")
  # prints the time remaining
  
  final_final_time = final_hour + final_minute + final_second
  if final_final_time <= 0:
    break
    # checks if final final time is 0 then breaks
  
  time.sleep(1)
  # waits a second




while True:
  audio.play_file("chrome music lab ring.wav")

````
this is the replit code as you can see from the package

### Conclusion

Overall I am pretty proud of myself for coding for this long.

I have worked almost non stop for 6 hours AND IT WAS FUN

This has never happened before - all my time on coding was on boring tutorials for at max 2 hours

I wish I had acted sooner and begun my programming journey earlier cause if I did who knows where I would be now

I guess now my training arc begins...
