# bug fixes and optimisation

I fixed a bug where the timer would go to 00:00:59 when finished instead of finishing at 0

didn't do a lot today cause it's mother's day and spending time with family

Also looked at making music with the bandlab web version

```` python
import time
from playsound import playsound


user_hour = int(input("Enter how many hours you would like it to last for: "))
user_minute = int(input("Enter how many minutes you would like it to last for: "))
user_second = int(input("Enter how many seconds you would like it to last for: "))
# asks for user input of time

if user_minute >= 60 or user_second >= 60:
  print ("\nplease change your minutes or seconds to 59 or below\n")
  exit()

  

def hour():
  final_hour = user_hour * 3600
  return final_hour
# calculates hours

def minute():
  final_minute = user_minute * 60
  return final_minute
# calculates minutes

final_second = user_second
# just to make it even


final_hour = hour()
final_minute = minute()
final_time = final_hour + final_minute + final_second
# calculates final time



print (f"That is {final_time} seconds")
time.sleep(0.5)
#some extra stuff to know
print (final_time)

for seconds in reversed(range(final_time + 1)):
  # checks if time is 0
  print (f"{final_hour // 3600:02}:{final_minute// 60:02}:{final_second:02}")
  # prints the time remaining

  final_second -= 1
  # takes away the seconds
  
  if final_second == -1:
    final_minute -= 60
    final_second = 59
    # checks if seconds == 0 then changes minutes
    if final_minute == -1:
      final_hour -= 1
      final_minute = 59 * 60
      # checks if minutes == 0 then changes hours
  
    # checks if final final time is 0 then breaks
  if final_time > 0:
    time.sleep(1)
  # waits a second





while True:
    playsound("chrome music lab ring.wav")
````
should work fine without any bugs now
