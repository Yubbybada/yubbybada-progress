# trying to make the sound continue

So I read some stack overflow stuff and the offical documentation and the easiest way to do it(I think) is to use the winsound plugin

I changed my sound thing from playsound to winsound

then I tried making the ringtone go on until stop is entered but I still havent figured that out yet

right now I have kind of a comprimise where my original code (where the user enters how many loops they want of the ringtone) and the new winsound stuff 
so I have something where the user enters how many loops they want and when the loops finish they have to enter stop for it to finish

```` python
 play_sound = True
  for x in range(sound_loop):
    winsound.PlaySound("chrome music lab ring.wav", winsound.SND_ALIAS|winsound.SND_ASYNC)

  play_sound = input("enter \"stop\" to stop")
  if play_sound == "continue" or "Stop":
    break
````

future me here it does not work I could have done that without winsound but I'm still gonna find a way tmr
